# Catalog API

This API catalog was built using Golang with the gin framework and also gorm for ORM on Golang.

If you want to run this API make sure you install the Go programming language

After that you create a database first so that GORM can carry out its work (make sure the database name is the same as the one in the database directory)

You can run this program by running

```sh
go run main.go
```
